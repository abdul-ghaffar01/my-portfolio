## Console Based E-commerce Store

### Overview
A **terminal-based e-commerce application** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++**.  
The system allows users to browse products, manage a shopping cart, and complete purchases â€” all within a **CLI environment**.  
It uses **file handling** for persistent product and user data storage.

---

### Key Features
- **Product Browsing** with details and pricing.
- **Shopping Cart** for adding/removing items.
- **Purchase Flow** with order confirmation.
- Persistent **file-based storage** for products and users.
- Fully **OOP modular design** for scalability.

### Architecture
- **Frontend:** Command-Line Interface (CLI).
- **Backend:** C++ with file handling for persistence.

### Development Notes
- Created separate classes for **Product**, **User**, and **Cart** to ensure clean OOP structure.
- Used **file I/O** for saving and retrieving data between sessions.
