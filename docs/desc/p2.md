# Full-stack Portfolio with Dockerized Microservices & DevOps Automation

## Overview

This project demonstrates the complete DevOps lifecycle for deploying a **microservices-based portfolio website**.  
The system is composed of multiple containerized services — a frontend (Next.js), backend API (Node.js), and an AI chatbot — orchestrated with **Docker Compose** and served via **Nginx** on an **Ubuntu VPS**.

A **CI/CD workflow** powered by **GitHub Webhooks** ensures that every code push automatically triggers a deployment pipeline, with **zero downtime**.  
The setup is designed for scalability, maintainability, and production-grade performance.

## Why I Built This

I wanted a **self-hosted, production-ready portfolio** that didn’t just showcase my projects, but also **demonstrated my backend, DevOps, and automation skills**.  
By using **Dockerized microservices** with **automated deployments**, I created a system that’s easy to scale, secure, and highly reliable — while giving me full control over my infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Containerized Architecture** – Each service (frontend, backend API, chatbot) runs in its own Docker container.
- **Reverse Proxy with SSL** – Nginx configured with **Certbot** for automatic HTTPS.
- **Zero Downtime Deployments** – Rolling restarts and health checks ensure smooth updates.
- **Fully Automated CI/CD** – GitHub Webhooks trigger build and deployment scripts on every push.
- **Scalable and Modular** – Services can be updated, replaced, or scaled independently.

## Tech Stack

| Layer         | Technology Used                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Frontend      | React / Next.js                   |
| Backend API   | Node.js                           |
| Reverse Proxy | Nginx + SSL (Certbot)             |
| Deployment    | Docker + Docker Compose on Ubuntu |
| Automation    | GitHub Webhooks + Shell Scripting |

## How It Works

1. **Containerization**

   - Each service is packaged into its own Docker image with dedicated configurations.
   - All services share a **custom Docker network** to enable inter-container communication.

2. **Reverse Proxy & SSL**

   - Nginx routes traffic to appropriate services.
   - **Certbot** automatically handles SSL certificate issuance and renewal.

3. **Deployment**

   - All containers are orchestrated with `docker-compose.yml`.
   - Services run on an **Ubuntu VPS** for full control.

4. **Automation**
   - GitHub Webhooks call a server-side deployment script on every `git push`.
   - The script:
     - Pulls the latest code.
     - Rebuilds Docker images.
     - Spins up new containers.
     - Removes old containers **only after** new ones pass health checks.

## Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Container Networking Issues

**Problem:** Services couldn’t communicate using `localhost`.  
**Solution:** Created a **dedicated Docker network** and used container service names.

### 2. SSL & Nginx Configuration

**Problem:** Manual SSL setup was error-prone.  
**Solution:** Automated SSL using **Certbot** and configured Nginx for WebSocket and reverse proxy.

### 3. Automated Deployment

**Problem:** Needed a way to update production automatically.  
**Solution:** Used **GitHub Webhooks** + Node.js + Shell scripting to trigger rebuilds and restarts.

### 4. Downtime During Rebuilds

**Problem:** Users experienced downtime during deployments.  
**Solution:** Implemented **rolling deployments** with health checks.

## Deployment Pipeline

1. Push code to GitHub → Webhook triggered.
2. VPS receives webhook payload.
3. Deployment script pulls latest code.
4. Docker builds and runs updated containers.
5. Old containers removed **only after** new ones are ready.
