## Why I Built This

I wanted a **full-featured e-learning platform** to showcase my skills in backend, frontend, database design, and deployment.  
This project aims to provide a seamless learning environment with user authentication, course creation, video lessons, quizzes, student progress tracking, and an admin/instructor dashboard.  
By building this platform I also wanted to practice **real-world architecture patterns, clean API design, responsive UI, and deployment workflows**.

Since the project is **still ongoing**, I plan to add features like notifications, analytics, interactive assignments, and possibly real-time chat or discussion threads for students in future updates.

## Architecture Overview

The system is composed of several key components:

1. **Frontend** – Built with **Next.js**, styled using **TailwindCSS**. Includes public-facing pages (courses list, course details, login/register) and user dashboards (student/instructor).  
2. **Backend API** – Built in **Golang** (GIN). Responsible for authentication (JWT), user roles (student, instructor), course/lesson management, quiz handling, enrollment management, and serving video lessons.  
3. **Database** – **PostgreSQL** stores users, roles, courses, lessons, quizzes, enrollments, submissions, and progress data.  
4. **Deployment Stack** – The application is deployed on a VPS: Golang backend server, Next.js frontend, Nginx (or a reverse proxy) for routing, with SSL configured for secure access. CI/CD pipelines handle build and deployment.  
5. **File & Media Handling** – Video lessons and media files are managed properly, with backend endpoints for uploads/downloads and secure access controls.

## Features (What It Does)

* ✅ User authentication with registration & login
* ✅ Role-based access: student, instructor, admin
* ✅ Course creation & management (instructor/admin)
* ✅ Video lesson upload and playback
* ✅ Quiz creation, submission, and results
* ✅ Enrollment and progress tracking for students
* ✅ Responsive UI with clean design (mobile + desktop)
* ✅ Admin/instructor dashboard + student dashboard

### Planned / Future Features

* 🔜 Notifications & email alerts
* 🔜 Analytics and progress reports for students and instructors
* 🔜 Interactive assignments or homework submission
* 🔜 Real-time discussion or chat feature for courses/classes
* 🔜 Export / download certificates or completion reports

## Deployment (Production)

* Frontend (Next.js) and Backend (Golang) deployed on VPS
* Nginx or reverse proxy used to route traffic (e.g. frontend on elearning.iabdulghaffar.com, APIs on elearning-backend.iabdulghaffar.com)
* SSL certificates (Let’s Encrypt) for HTTPS
* Environment variables used for configuration (DB credentials, JWT secret, etc.)
* CI/CD / automation for updates (pull, build, deploy)

## What I Learned & Key Takeaways

* How to design a **scalable database schema** (PostgreSQL) for e-learning features (users, courses, lessons, quizzes, enrollments).
* How to build a **clean REST API** in Golang with authentication, role-based access, and secure media handling.
* How to build a **modern, responsive frontend** with Next.js and TailwindCSS that supports dashboards, authentication flow, and content rendering.
* How to manage **deployment, environment configuration, and server setup** for full-stack applications on a VPS.
* How to think about application architecture — separating frontend, backend, database, deployments — to allow independent scalability and maintainability.
