## Why I Built This

I wanted a **full-featured blog platform** integrated into my portfolio to showcase my backend, frontend, and deployment skills. This project is designed to support modern UI patterns, featured posts, categories, and an admin dashboard for managing content.  
It also serves as a way to experiment with **SEO-friendly slugs**, responsive design, and automated deployment pipelines.  

Since it’s **still ongoing**, I’m planning to add features like search, advanced analytics, and AI-assisted blog writing in the future.

## Architecture Overview

The blog system is composed of several key components:

1. **Frontend** – Built with **Next.js**, styled with **TailwindCSS** and custom theme variables for light/dark modes. It includes a featured blog carousel, categories section, and individual blog pages with clean typography.
2. **Backend API** – Built with **Node.js + Express**, handling CRUD operations for blogs, categories, and media uploads.
3. **Database** – **MongoDB** stores blog data, categories, and metadata such as view counts and created dates.
4. **Admin Dashboard** – A secure dashboard for creating, editing, deleting, and scheduling blog posts.
5. **Deployment Stack** – **Nginx reverse proxy**, **PM2** for process management, and **GitHub webhooks** for automated deployments.

## Deployment on VPS

1. **VPS Setup**
   - Configured **Nginx** as a reverse proxy to serve both frontend and backend.
   - Set up firewall rules for HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) traffic.
   - Installed **PM2** to manage Node.js processes and restart them automatically.

2. **Domain Configuration**
   - Main portfolio site runs at `iabdulghaffar.com`.
   - Blog system runs as a subdomain `blogs.iabdulghaffar.com`.
   - SSL certificates configured via **Let’s Encrypt**.

3. **GitHub Webhook Integration**
   - Any push to the `main` branch triggers a deployment script on the VPS.
   - The script pulls the latest code, installs dependencies, builds the project, and restarts services.

## Key Takeaways

- **SEO-Friendly** – Slug-based URLs for better search engine ranking.
- **Scalable** – Backend, frontend, and database run as separate processes, allowing for independent scaling.
- **Theme-Consistent** – Fully integrated with my global theme variables for cohesive branding.
- **Automated Deployments** – GitHub webhooks ensure updates go live instantly without manual deployment steps.
