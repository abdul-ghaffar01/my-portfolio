## Authentication System (Ongoing)

### Overview

This project is a **JWT-based authentication system** with **role-based access control (RBAC)**, designed for security, scalability, and ease of integration into future applications.  
While still in development, the goal is to provide a modular and production-ready authentication layer.

---

### Key Features (Implemented so far)

- **JWT Authentication** for secure login and registration.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to define and manage user permissions.
- **Middleware-based API Security** for protecting routes and resources.

---

### Architecture

- **Frontend:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (handles UI, API calls, and client-side session management)
- **Backend:** [Golang](https://go.dev/) API (handles authentication logic, token generation, and role validation)
- **Authentication:** JWT for token-based login + RBAC for permission handling

---

### Current Status

The core authentication flow is functional, but the following are still being developed:

- Admin dashboard for managing roles.
- Refresh token mechanism for extended sessions.
- Unit and integration testing.
- Deployment pipeline with Docker and Nginx.
